# Update bashrc
# Motivation: There are a lot of different shells. Most of them are very similar. While I don't 
# like scripting in bash, it is very common, and I do most of my scripting in python anyways.
sudo cp bash-rc ~/.bashrc

# Install Brave Browser
# Motivation: I want a vim-like browser. Qute-browser is ok, but does hit some edge cases where
# keyboard navigation is not possible. Chromium based browsers support the vimium extension, which
# adds most of the functionality that qute-browser has, while also being compatible with most websites.
sudo snap install brave
cfg="$HOME/.config/BraveSoftware/Brave-Browser/External Extensions"
mkdir -p "$cfg"

# Vimium
cat > "$cfg/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb.json" <<'EOF'
{ "external_update_url": "https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx" }
EOF

# Dark Reader
cat > "$cfg/eimadpbcbfnmbkopoojfekhnkhdbieeh.json" <<'EOF'
{ "external_update_url": "https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx" }

# Install Ghostty, and ghostty config
# Motivation: Ghostty is super easy to configure, and has enough native features such that I don't
# need other applications (e.g. tmux or screen).
sudo snap install ghostty
sudo cp ghostty-config ~/.config/ghostty/config

# Install git, and git config
# Motivation: A non-linear graph-based version control system is simply the best way to manage
# code, particularly in environment where multiple people are working on the same codebase at
# the same time. Git isn't perfect, but with proper branching and merging strategies, it works 
# very well.
sudo apt install -y git
sudo cp git-config ~/.gitconfig

# Install Nvim
# Motivation: Nvim supports lua scripting. So I can make a single init file, that sets everything
# up the exact way I want it, and is portable across different systems. Vim isn't for everyone, but
# I'm used to it, and normal vim isn't as easy to configure as nvim.
sudo snap install --edge --classic nvim
sudo cp nvim-init.lua ~/.config/nvim/init.lua

# Install Native gcc
# Motivation: Some projects or tests need to be compiled for the native architecture.
sudo apt install -y build-essential

# Install ARM gcc
# Motivation: Most of my development is for ARM microcontrollers.
sudo apt install -y gcc-arm-none-eabi

# Install ninja and meson
# Motivation: Build systems for C are difficult. Meson using ninja has been the smoothest
# experience I've had so far, and integrates well with python scripting.
sudo apt install ninja-build meson -y

# Install JLink
# Motivation: JLink programmers/debuggers aren't perfect, but I've had good luck with them
# and they support a wide variety of devices.
sudo apt install -y JLink_Linux_V872_x86_64.deb

# Install invoke
# Motivation: I do a lot of scripting in python, and invoke makes it easy to create command line
# tools for running common tasks.
sudo apt install -y python3-invoke

# Install Zig
# Motivation: Zig is, in my opinion, the best replacement for C. It adds in all of the features that
# C should have had and nothing more. I enjoy programming in C, and Zig makes it even better.
sudo snap install --beta --classic zig

# Install Node.js and npm
# Motivation: Some tools I use for web development and other tasks require node.js and npm.
sudo apt install -y nodejs npm

# Install Variety, Hook in Desktop Backgrounds
# Motivation: I like rotating backgrounds for variety, and variety makes it easy to do so.
sudo apt install -y variety
mkdir ~/backgrounds
mkdir root-and-rail
git clone https://github.com/djhoggatt/root-and-rail ./root-and-rail
sudo cp ./root-and-rail/images /usr/local/bin/
sudo rm -rf ./root-and-rail

# Install microcom
# Motivation: All I want is a simple serial terminal that I can run from the command line
# with minimal configuration.
sudo apt install -y microcom
